 For Haitians, From Haitians
At For Haitians, From Haitians, our mission is to empower the Haitian community to rebuild Haiti from within. Through the donations we receive, we aim to create more jobs, provide housing, support educational initiatives, and offer various forms of aid.
With an estimated 1.2 million Haitians living outside of Haiti, if each of us contributes just $20 a month, we could collectively generate around $24,000,000 monthly. Our goal is to restore Haiti to its former glory as the richest island in the Western Hemisphere, all through our collective efforts.
By relying on our own resources, we aim to eliminate the need for external assistance, fostering a sense of pride and independence that honors the legacy of our ancestors who fought for Haiti's freedom. Together, we can ensure that Haiti not only survives but thrives.
